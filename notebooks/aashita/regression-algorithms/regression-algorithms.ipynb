In that case, they can be coupled with Ridge regression, Lasso regression or Elastic Net regression - extensions of linear regression algorithm that use regularization, a method to address overfitting.\n\n### Regularization:\nWhen we have weights that are higher in magnitude, the model is more likely to overfit, so we penalize the weights using a penalty term called regularization parameter (alpha) that keeps the weights small and thereby simplify the model.\n\nTo the linear regression formulation of the cost function, we add the model weights multiplied by the regularization parameter (alpha) so that when the learning process minimizes the cost function while updating the weights, it automatically keeps the weights in check. There are two common ways to add the weights term (using $L1$ and $L2$-norms) and hence the two different algorithms as below.\n\nCost function for Linear regression:\n$$ J = \\frac{1}{2 n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y^{(i)} - y_{pred}^{(i)})^2 $$\n\nCost function for Ridge regression ($L2$-norm):\n$$ J = \\frac{1}{2 n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y^{(i)} - y_{pred}^{(i)})^2 + \\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^m w_j^2$$\n\nCost function for Lasso regression ($L1$-norm):\n$$ J = \\frac{1}{2 n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y^{(i)} - y_{pred}^{(i)})^2 + \\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^m |w_j|$$\n\n\nFor each algorithm, the learning process is the same as linear regression, that is we update the weights using gradient descent to minimize the respective cost function. Since weights are included in the cost function, the learning process takes a balanced approach between minimizing mean-square errors and the weights, thereby reducing overfitting. \n\nThis technique of regularization by adding the weight term to the cost function using either $L1$ or $L2$-norm is one of the two most commonly used and crucial techniques to address overfitting in deep neural networks as well. The other one being [Dropout regularization](https://medium.com/@amarbudhiraja/https-medium-com-amarbudhiraja-learning-less-to-learn-better-dropout-in-deep-machine-learning-74334da4bfc5) - dropping out units in the network.\n\n\nWe use [`sklearn.linear_model.Lasso`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html) to train a Lasso regression model on the polynomial features."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"polyreg_lasso = Lasso(alpha=100).fit(X_train_poly, y_train_poly)\n\nprint('R-squared score (training): {:.3f}'\n     .format(polyreg_lasso.score(X_train_poly, y_train_poly)))\nprint('R-squared score (validation): {:.3f}'\n     .format(polyreg_lasso.score(X_valid_poly, y_valid_poly)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Please try different alpha values for the above, such as alpha=5, 500, 5000, etc. and see how it affects the model performance.\n\nNow we use [`sklearn.linear_model.Ridge`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Ridge.html) to train a Ridge regression model.
