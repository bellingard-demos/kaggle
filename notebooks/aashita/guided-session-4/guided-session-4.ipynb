We trained a classifier that correctly detects almost all the subjects with cancer, but also misclassify certain subjects that do not have it. The total accuracy of our classifier is 96%. \n\nQ: If we are given another classifier that have an accuracy of 99%. Should we prefer it over ours?   \nQ: If not, why? What additional information we would like to have to decide?\n\nTo answer this, suppose I built a dummy classifier that always predict that a subject do not have cancer. It will be right 99% of the time and hence 99% accuracy. This suggests that accuracy is not a good metric when the classes are imbalanced. \n\nQ: Suppose we were able to get additional dataset and now almost half of the subjects in our dataset were diagonized with the cancer. Is accuracy now a good choice to compare two classifiers?\n\nKey takeaway: Accuracy is a good metric for evaluating classifier performance only when the classes are more or less equally distributed and classifying each class carries the same priority.

This valiadation set gives us an estimate for how well our model will generalize to unseen data. We similarly use this validation set to tune the hyperparameters, for example finding the optimal value for the regularization parameter alpha. This cross-validation method has a shortcoming similar to overfitting. The overfitting happens when our model captures noise and patterns present in the training dataset that are not present in the unseen data. It can also happen that our split of the training and validation is not entirely random, and that one of the subset has patterns/characteristics not present in the entire dataset. More commonly, it happens that when we use validation set to tune our hyperparameters, they often overfit to the validation set. For example, we find an optimal value for the regularization parameter using a validation set, and it turned out to be not-so-optimal for the unseen test data. To solve this problem, it is a common practise to use k-fold cross-validation, especially for tuning hyperparameters.\n\n1. Randomly divide the dataset into k-groups\n2. For each group, we train the algorithm on the remaining k-1 groups and evaluate its performance on this group treating it as the validation set. \n\nThus, we train k different models and have performance scores for each one of them.

Using all the features can lead to a very complex model that would be prone to overfitting if we do not have the sufficient number of training examples in our dataset. A simple way to address this is to discard features.\n\nQ: How do we know which features to discard? \n\nSometimes, the features that do not seem to have much impact on the target variable individually might prove to be very useful in conjunction with other features. If we do not want to risk losing information by discarding features, we use dimensionality reduction techniques. The most commonly used one is Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n\n\n### Principal Component Analysis (PCA):\n\nIf we have 100 features, we can think of having 100 dimensional feature space with an axis for each feature. In essence, we transform our 100 old features into 100 new ones, ranked in the order of importance. To accomplish this, we rotate the axis of the features to capture the most variability of data in our first principal axis and then try to capture as much from the remaining variability as possible in the second axis and so on. We ultimately keep only as many features as we want, discarding the least important ones and thus, reducing the dimension.\n\n![](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicholas_Czarnek/publication/320410861/figure/fig7/AS:551041819447302@1508390015760/Example-application-of-principal-component-analysis-to-simple-synthetic-data-The-black.png)\n\nIn the figure, we have transformed the two dimensional data using PCA. If we want to reduce it to one-dimension, we will simply discard the principal component 2, having captured most of the variability in the principal component 1.  The downside of PCA is that the new features are no longer as interpretable, and unlike the old features, we cannot explain what they exactly represent. The upside is that we have captured as much variability as possible in fewer features.\n\nPCA is useful in machine learning for purposes other than dimensionality reduction. The linear models rely on the assumption that the features are independent of each other. In general, features from real-world datasets are not entirely independent, but if we transform them using PCA, the new features become independent of each other. This makes new features much more suited to build linear models such as linear/ridge/lasso regression and logistic classifier. Other uses of this technique involves data compression and visualization of data (when the number of features are reduced to 2 or 3).\n\nThe steps in PCA are outlined below. It would be Okay to skip this and revisit later after learning/revising linear algebra, especially eigen-values and eigen-vectors.\n* First create a matrix for which each row is an observation and each column is a feature (similar to our dataframe, but all columns must be numerical values). \n* Center each column around zero by substracting the respective mean from each column.  \n* Compute the covariance matrix\n* Find the eigen values and the eigen vectors for the covariance matrix. \n* Normalize each of the eigenvector to become unit vector.\n\nWe pick the largest eigen value and the corresponding eigen vector becomes our first principal component (or first new axis). The eigen vector corresponding to the second largest eigen value becomes our second component and so on.\n\nNote: We must always normalize the data before PCA. \n\nThe following is the implementation of PCA using [`sklearn.decomposition.PCA`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# First we create a dataset for demonstration\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_classification\nX1, y1 = make_classification(\n    n_samples=300, n_features=2, \n    n_redundant=0, n_informative=2, \n    n_classes=2, n_clusters_per_class=1, \n    class_sep=1, weights=[0.8, 0.2],\n    flip_y=0.05, random_state=0 \n)\n\n# We fit the PCA transformer and transform our dataset\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\npca = PCA(n_components=2)\npca.fit(X1)\nX_pca = pca.transform(X1)\n\n# Plotting\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nplt.title(\"Before PCA\")\nplt.axis(\"equal\")\nplt.scatter(X1[:, 0], X1[:, 1], marker='o', c=y1,\n            s=25, edgecolor='k');\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nplt.title(\"After PCA\")\nplt.axis(\"equal\")\nplt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1], marker='o', c=y1,\n            s=25, edgecolor='k');\nplt.tight_layout()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Another dimensionality reduction technique is [Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)](https://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_lda.html).
