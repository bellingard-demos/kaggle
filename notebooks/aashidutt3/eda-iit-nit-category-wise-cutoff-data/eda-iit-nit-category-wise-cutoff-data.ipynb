The exam is conducted by the JEE Apex Board for Admission for B.Tech, B.Arch, etc. programs in the premier technical institutes such as the National Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Information Technology are based on the rank secured in the JEE-Main. It is usually conducted twice every year.\n\n**IITs and NITs:**\nThe Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are the globally appreciated engineering and technological institutes in India. IITs have maintained quality education and internationally acclaimed research facilities. IIT JEE Exam is the most popular engineering admission entrance test conducted in India.\nNational Institute of Technology (NITs) are premier engineering colleges in India offering admission to degree courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate level.\n\n# **<span style=\"color:#cd486b;\">üìÅAbout the files</span>**\n\n**year**\tThe year of the conducted JEE exam\t\n\n**institute_type**\tType of Institute (IIT or NIT)\t\n\n**round_no**\tThe counseling round number\t\n\n**quota**\tThe reservation quota\t\n\nAI: All-India,\n\nHS: Home-State,\n\nOS: Other-State,\n\nAP: Andhra Pradesh,\n\nGO: Goa,\n\nJK: Jammu & Kashmir,\n\nLA: Ladakh\n\n**pool**\tThe gender quota\n\n**institute_short**\tTHe short name of the Institution\t\n\n**program_name**\tThe name of the program/stream\t\n\n**program_duration**\tThe duration of the course (in years)\t\n\n**degree_short**\tThe name of the degree (Abbreviated)\t\n\n**category**\tThe caste category\t\n\nGEN: General,\n\nOBC-NCL: Other Backward Classes-Non Creamy Layer,\n\nSC: Scheduled Castes, \n\nST: Scheduled Tribes, \n\nGEN-PWD: General & Persons with Disabilities, \n\nOBC-NCL-PWD: Other Backward Classes & Persons with Disabilities,\n\nSC-PWD: Scheduled Castes & Persons with Disabilities, \n\nST-PWD: Scheduled Tribes & Persons with Disabilities, \n\nGEN-EWS: General & Economically Weaker Section,\n\nGEN-EWS-PWD: General & Economically Weaker Section & Persons with Disability\n\n**opening_rank**\tThe opening (starting) rank for getting admission in the institution\t\n\n**closing_rank**\tThe closing (ending) rank for getting admission in the institution\t\n\n**is_preparatory**\tIf admission to a preparatory course is available\t0: No, 1: Yes\n\n\n**Acknowledgement:**\n*This data is provided by scraping the website: https://cutoffs.iitr.ac.in/*\n*All credits and rights belong to them.*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import seaborn as sns\n\n#Custom Colors\nclass clr:\n    S = '\\033[1m' + '\\033[96m'\n    E = '\\033[0m'\n    \nmy_colors = [\"#E0BBE4\", \"#957DAD\", \"#D291BC\", \"#FEC8D8\", \"#FFDFD3\", \"#D1D8FD\"]\n\nprint(clr.S + \"Notebook Color Scheme: \" + clr.E)\nsns.palplot(sns.color_palette(my_colors))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-24T05:36:54.756631Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-24T05:36:54.757832Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-24T05:36:56.182647Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-24T05:36:54.757717Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-24T05:36:56.180961Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np #
