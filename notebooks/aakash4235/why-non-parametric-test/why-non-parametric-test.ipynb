Skewness and kurtosis for a normal distribution is roughly about 0 and 3 respectively (in some cases +/-2 and +/-7 respectively).\n\nNon-parametric test across elementry stats is chi-square test. However, there are many more tests. Ex: In this data we'll be using *Mann Whitney test* which is non-parametric and alternative to the Two sample t-test however not always.\n\nDisadvantages with non-parametric test is that they are time consuming as most of the calculation is done by hand. Also, critical value tables for many tests arenâ€™t included in many computer software packages. So, you need to check them manually."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(r'/kaggle/input/women-entrepreneurship-and-labor-force/Dataset3.csv',sep=';')\ndf","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Checking the correlation(spearman rank) of the numerical columns."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.heatmap(df.corr(method='spearman'), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', linewidths=0.2, linecolor='white')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### It can be clearly seen that ***Women Enterpreneurship Index*** is highly positive correlated with ***Global Enterpreneuship Index*** then by ***Female Labor Force Participaton Rate***  and neagatively correlated with ***Inflation Rate***.\n\n### We have seen the affect of numerical columns but what about categorical columns?\n#### Here we will introduce *Mann Whitney test*\n\n#### It is used to compare differences between two independent groups when the dependent variable is either ordinal or continuous, but not normally distributed. \n\n### NOTE: Before you run this test make sure to go through the assumptions of Mann Whitney test."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from scipy import stats","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Hypothesis:\n\n***Null Hypothesis :*** Women Entrepreneurship Index values show a statistically significant difference between the countries that are develpoed and developing.\n\n***Alternate Hypothesis :*** Women Entrepreneurship Index values do not show a statistically significant difference between the countries that are developed and developing.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# If you try to serve 'Level of development' column directly to test than mann whitlney test won't run.\ndf_develop = df[df['Level of development'] == 'Developed']\ndf_developing = df[df['Level of development'] == 'Developing']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"a = stats.mannwhitneyu(list(df_develop['Women Entrepreneurship Index']), \n                       list(df_developing['Women Entrepreneurship Index']))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('u-statistic for Level of Development ', a[0])\nprint('p-value: ', a[1])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Rejecting Null hypothesis as p-value is very small which means:\n\nWomen Entrepreneurship Index values do not show a statistically significant difference between the countries that are developed and developing."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Hypothesis:\n***Null Hypothesis :*** Women Entrepreneurship Index values show a statistically significant difference between the countries that are members of the European Union and not.\n\n***Alternate Hypothesis :*** Women Entrepreneurship Index values do not show a statistically significant difference between the countries that are members of the European Union and not.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_mem = df[df['European Union Membership'] == 'Member']\ndf_non_mem = df[df['European Union Membership'] == 'Not Member']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"b = stats.mannwhitneyu(list(df_mem['Women Entrepreneurship Index']),\n                      list(df_non_mem['Women Entrepreneurship Index']))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('u statistic for European Union Membership : ', b[0])\nprint('p-value: ', b[1])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Rejecting Null hypothesis as p-value is small.\n#### So, Women Entrepreneurship Index values do not show a statistically significant difference between the countries that are members of the European Union and not.\n\nWe have seen almost every column relations with women entretreneurship index.
