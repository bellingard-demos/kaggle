In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how to use Comet with Yolov5 to train a dataset Artifact and track model metrics, inspect model outputs, restart interrupted runs, and more!\n\nComet Artifacts allow you to version  any type of data asset, as well as track their lineages through a project. For this tutorial, we'll be using the publicly-available `penguin-detection-dataset`, but feel free to create your own, or upload your trained yolov5 model as an Artifact at the end of this tutorial!

For this tutorial, we will choose the weights corresponding to the \"small\" `yolov5s` checkpoint.\n\nAdditionally, we can log model predictions (and their associated images) by passing the **`bbox_interval`** command line argument. These bounding box predictions can then be visualized using Comet's Object Detection Custom Panel.\n\nHere is an **[example project using the Panel](https://www.comet.com/examples/comet-example-yolov5?shareable=YcwMiJaZSXfcEXpGOHDD12vA1&ref=yolov5?utm_source=Kaggle&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Kaggle_ANM)**, or see the gif below:\n\n```\npython tools/benchmarking/benchmark.py \\\n--config <relative-or-absolute-path>/<paramfile>.yaml\n\n\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!python train.py \\\n--img 640 \\\n--batch 16 \\\n--epochs 3 \\\n--data ./penguins.yaml \\\n--weights yolov5s.pt \\\n--bbox_interval 1","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-20T17:12:55.407814Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-20T17:12:55.408217Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-20T17:14:32.20119Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-02-20T17:12:55.408183Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-20T17:14:32.199986Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[![penguins_yolov5-2.gif](https://s5.gifyu.com/images/penguins_yolov5-2.gif)](https://www.comet.com/site/)\n\n# üõ† Configure Custom Comet Logging\n\n\nComet's custom logging capabilities don't end there! Track and visualize model metrics in real time, save your hyperparameters, datasets, and model checkpoints, and visualize your model predictions with **[Comet Custom Panels](https://www.comet.com/docs/v2/guides/comet-dashboard/code-panels/about-panels/?utm_source=Kaggle&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Kaggle_ANM)**! Here are a few more examples of what we can do with just a simple command line flag or environment variable:\n\n## Uploading a Dataset to Comet Artifacts\n\n\nIf you would like to store your data using **[Comet Artifacts](https://www.comet.com/docs/v2/guides/data-management/using-artifacts/?utm_source=Kaggle&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Kaggle_ANM)**, you can do so using the `upload_dataset` flag.\n\nThe dataset be organized in the way described in the **[YOLOv5 documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tutorials/train-custom-datasets/#3-organize-directories)**. The dataset config `yaml` file must follow the same format as that of the `coco128.yaml` file (built-in to Yolov5) or the `penguins.yaml` file (shown above).\n\n```\n!python train.py \\\n--img 640 \\\n--batch 16 \\\n--epochs 5 \\\n--data ./penguins.yaml \\\n--weights yolov5s.pt \\\n--upload_dataset \"train\"\n```\n\n### Using a saved Artifact\n\nIf you would like to use a different dataset from Comet Artifacts, or if you would like to be able to try different datasets on the same model, simply set the `path` variable in your dataset `yaml` file to point to the following Artifact resource URL:\n\n```\n# contents of artifact.yaml file\npath:\"comet://<workspace name>/<artifact name>:<artifact version or alias>\"\n```\nThen pass your file to your training script with this command:\n\n```\n!echo \"path: \\\"comet://<workspace name>/<artifactnam>:<artifact version or alias>\\\"\" >> /content/yolov5/data/artifact.yaml\n\n!python train.py \\\n--img 640 \\\n--batch 16 \\\n--epochs 5 \\\n--data /content/yolov5/data/artifact.yaml \\\n--weights yolov5s.pt \\\n```\n\n## Logging Checkpoints with Comet\n\nLogging Models to Comet is disabled by default, but to enable it, just pass the `save-period` argument to the training script. This will save the\nlogged checkpoints to Comet based on the interval value provided to `save-period`.\n\nFind yor checkpoints in the **[Assets and Artifacts](https://www.comet.com/examples/comet-example-yolov5/a0e29e0e9b984e4a822db2a62d0cb357?assetId=7df85817e69b4997a803f947334155e6&assetPath=models%2Cyolov5&experiment-tab=assets?utm_source=Kaggle&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Kaggle_ANM)** tab in your Experiment.\n\n```\n!python train.py \\\n--img 640 \\\n--batch 16 \\\n--epochs 5 \\\n--data coco128.yaml \\\n--weights yolov5s.pt \\\n--save-period 1 \n```\n\nYou can find the uploaded dataset in the Artifacts tab in your Comet workspace and you can preview the data directly in the Comet UI. Artifacts are versioned and also support adding metadata. Comet will automatically log this metadata from your dataset `yaml` file.\n\n### Controlling the number of Prediction Images logged to Comet\n\nWhen logging predictions from YOLOv5, Comet will log the images associated with each set of predictions. By default a maximum of 100 validation images are logged. You can increase or decrease this number using the `COMET_MAX_IMAGE_UPLOADS` environment variable.\n\n```\n!env COMET_MAX_IMAGE_UPLOADS=200 python train.py \\\n--img 640 \\\n--batch 16 \\\n--epochs 5 \\\n--data coco128.yaml \\\n--weights yolov5s.pt \\\n--bbox_interval 1\n```\n\n### Logging Class Level Metrics\n\nUse the `COMET_LOG_PER_CLASS_METRICS` environment variable to log mAP, precision, recall, f1 for each class.\n\n```!env COMET_LOG_PER_CLASS_METRICS=true python train.py \\\n--img 640 \\\n--batch 16 \\\n--epochs 5 \\\n--data coco128.yaml \\\n--weights yolov5s.pt \n```\n\n## Resuming a Training Run\n\nIf your training run is interrupted for any reason, e.g. disrupted internet connection, you can resume the run using the `resume` flag and the Comet Run Path.\n\nThe Run Path has the following format `comet://<your workspace name>/<your project name>/<experiment id>`.\n\nThis will restore the run to its state before the interruption, which includes restoring the  model from a checkpoint, restoring all hyperparameters and training arguments and downloading Comet dataset Artifacts if they were used in the original run. The resumed run will continue logging to the existing Experiment in the Comet UI\n\n```\n!python train.py \\\n--resume \"comet://<your run path>\"\n```","metadata":{}}]}
