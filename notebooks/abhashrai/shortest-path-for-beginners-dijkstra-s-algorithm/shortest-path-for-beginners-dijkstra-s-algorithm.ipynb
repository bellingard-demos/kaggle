Dijkstra in 1956, is a well-known and widely used pathfinding\ntechnique for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It initializes the source node with a\ndistance of zero and iteratively selects the node with the smallest distance as the current node, exploring its\nneighbors and updating distances. One key feature is its greedy approach, always choosing the node with\nthe smallest distance, leading to the shortest path. It can handle weighted graphs, considering edge\nweights in distance calculations for optimizing costs.
